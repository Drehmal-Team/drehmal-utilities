Ntils is designed as a highly modular datapack library that can be used and edited by anyone. However, to make sure that the way that discrete modules function is consistent, strict code standards are in place to make

## Header Comments

All API functions in the datapack should have a header comment explaining what the function does, what input/output it takes, and how performant it is.

For more information, see [[Header Comments]]

## Namespacing

To ensure proper orthogonality and prevent side effects, proper namespacing should be performed when accessing scoreboards, storages, tags, and everything else.
